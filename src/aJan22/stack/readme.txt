//Template

Pattern 1:
  While(there are elements to add)
     If the POP condition is met
        Pop until another condition is met
        Processes the popped elements
        Add the popped elements back to stack if necessary
     else
      Keep adding new elements to the stack

Pattern 2:
*  In string problems, think about using a stringbuilder and storing the indices of the string in the stack instead
   MinRemovalForValidParantheses is a good example of the above.
