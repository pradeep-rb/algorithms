Intuition:

Asked to find the min operation.
various combinations of operations are possible. We gotta pick the minimum
 are there decisions to make at ever step/operation ?  are there overlapping subroblems ?
 yes on both accounts

DP is obvious at this point.  TD or Bottom Up ?
Bottom seem more in this case as this is less about decisions and more about
interleaving/overlapping subproblems

* 2D DP array
* Key:  every cell would represent the 'edit distance' and not the number of operations needed



word1[i] = word2[j]
    d[i][j] = 1 +  min (d[i-1][j], d[i][j-1], d[i-1][j-1] -1)

word1[i] != word2[j]
   d[i][j] = 1 +  min (d[i-1][j], d[i][j-1], d[i-1][j-1])
