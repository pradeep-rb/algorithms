    /*
        Algo:
        1) for every pair of words A[i], A[j] that are supposed to overlap, find the number of characters
        tha  needed to be appended to A[i] if A[j] came after it (non overlapping chars from A[j])
        Store this info in a graph / adjacency matrix

        2) We need to find the shortest permutation of elements in A
        This is a Traveling SalesMan problem of finding the shortest distance while visiting all nodes in a graph.
        Keep track of a state transition matrix of all states against the nodes to visit.
        Keep track of a path matrix that can give you the last node added for every state. This can be used for the reconstruction
        of the shortest path
