ESSENCE OF MAKING RECURRENCE RELAITONS
*** WHAT DECISIONS DO I NEED TO BE MAKING WHEN I PERFORM TASK(I) ***
** FIND A WAY TO MAKE TASK(I) A FUNCTION OF PREVIOUS DECISIONS :  I-1.. I-2 ETC..

* if the return type is integer i.e maximize or minimize something, bottom DP is preferabble
* if the return type calls for a list of strings / paths traversed in the decision tree -
                            Top down / backtracking with memoization is preferred
*  look for number of states when calculating Big(0). check memo for the states
* since one is trying to account for all possibilities at a step, you don't have to try to do any optimizations.
  Always try to come up with the simplest recurrance relation without trying to optimize too much

stock 1 2 3.  stock 3 gives you an idea of using multi dimensional dp array
robber 1, 2 3: gets you to think about multiple starting states
               robber 3 presents a variation involving recursion and bottom up DP, in addition to using top down with memoization to solve it
paint fence: gets you to really pay attention to how to compute the ans at step i from previous steps i -1, i- 2 etc..
jump game  2, 7: further solidifies the concept of solving i from i-1 to 0 steps
            7 : presents a variation using sliding window to compute the answer in one pass using a cumulative result: especially
            handy when boolean logic is involved.
            7 is also related to [523. Continuous Subarray Sum] for a the 'cumulative'ness
DeleteAndEarn:  another variation where the input is decomposed in to something that lends itself better to bottom-up DP'
                and Top down dp for that matter.
                another variation: rearranging the input by say sorting, if the rearrangement makes sense
Trapping Rain Water:  Another problem that gets decomposed in to a DP problem




TOP DOWN VS Bottom Up

Top down is usually good / better for decision problems.
Bottom up is usually good for interleaving sub problems.

718:  Maximum length of repeated subarray
Input: A = [1,2,3,2,1], B = [3,2,1,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The repeated subarray with maximum length is [3,2,1].
subarray start at i from A and j from B
if A[i]==B[i]
dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j+1] + 1
---------

322: coin change
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
DP on amount( i is amount)
dp[i] = 1 + min (dp[i - C1], dp[i - C2],.... dp[i - Ck])
----------------

91. Decode Ways
Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).

Following is the intuition behind the dp solution. (It can be easily developed by doing examples of up to dp[4])
At poistion i, we can simply add the new character to the end of the path taken so far or combine it  with the previous character at i-1
No. of paths after simply adding a new character  to the paths that ended at i-1 =  DP[i-1]
No. of paths after  combining the  new character  with prev character(are the paths that ended at i-2 ) =  DP[i-2]
therefore dp[i] = d[i-1] + dp[i-2]. but conditions apply (you can't always combine)

----------------------------
5. Longest Palindromic Substring
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.

mistake:  picked an index, using that center started expanding. Was thinking of a 1D DP. Coming up with a recurrance relation was difficult
solutuion:  2d  boolean DP. Base =   if i == j, dp[i][j] == true,
recurrence: dp[i][j] =  dp[i-1][j+1]  if a[i] == a[j].  keep track of max as j - i  and save the index of the max value
-----------------------------
1048. Longest String Chain *******  good probem cz it has sevaral dp soln.

1st Suboptimal dp Solution
sort asc word length
dp[i]   = dp[j] + 1  ( j is from 0 to i-1) if a[i] is a predecessor
Complexity :  O ( NlogN  + N^2L)=  o(N( logN + NL))  - This might be ineffiecient if N >>> L

2nd better dp solution
sort asc word length
for word i, delete one character at a time and get the predecessor length from a DP map
* Here the memoization happens in a map instead of DP array. The map stores predecessors with the lenght of the word chain formed so far
Complexity:  Why is bottom up  DP approach Time complexity:  O (N (logN + L^2)). instead of O (N (logN + L)).
Where did the extra L come from ?  It says L is for creating each predecessor.
The remove charAt(i) on stringBuilder incurrs a cost of L I guess.

983.  Min cost of tickets   1 day or 7 day or 30 passes with costs[i].  Minimize $$$
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total, you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.

solution:
if not traveling on day i then dp[i] = dp[i-1]
if traveling on day i then dp[i] =  min ( 2+ dp[i-2],  7+ dp[i-7], 15 + dp[i-30])

312 Bursting Balloons: probably the hardest DP problem
The number of states in the solutions seems to evolve as follows 1) all possible permutations N!. 2) all possible subsets in a set 2^n.
 3)all possible subarrays in an array N* ((N+1)/2) ~ N^2. So the question we need to ask ourselves is how can I reduce the number of states?
By memoization obviously. But if memoization still doesn't get you a linear run time complexity, then perhaps there is a better way to memoize.
The important takeaway from the problems are not the solutions themselves but,
learning to think about the number of states involved in each solution and trying to see if there is a better way to reduce the number of states.
Knowing that there are N^2 subarrays in an array (and therefore N^2 states) will now force me to want to divide any array that I see / look for a potential divide  and conquer solution.

300 Longest increasing subsequence. (check 435)
Arrays.fill(dp, 1)
if(arr[j] > arr[i])  dp[i] =  Math.max( dp[i], 1+dp[j])
return max(dp)
Same technique can be used for finding longest overlapping intervals(435)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
32H. Longest Valid Parentheses

Pretty obvious that this is a dp problem. However the recurrance relation is not.
brute force: all possible subset and check if the substring is valid. o(n^3) complexity
Was thinking on the lines of top down :  Top down is usually good for decision problems. For interleaving subproblems, bottom up DP is better
Started with a 2D dp. Found a pattern but its too difficult to implement.
Next stop 1D DP. This would mean the solution is O(n)
Check  i and i-1
case 1:  if they are () then  DP[i] = DP[i-2] + 2;
case 2:  if they are )) then
            if   S[i - DP[i-1] - 1]  = '(' then

            DP[i] = DP[i-1] + 2  + dp[i - DP[i-1] - 2]

2209H. Minimum White Tiles After Covering With Carpets

dp[i][j] =  The  count of the white tiles left after, going through i tiles and covering
them up with j carpets.

** revise / learning:  complicated things by thinking of how covering tile i also covers tile i+1, i+2..
and trying to form a recurrance relation taking that in to account, in the spirit of trying to optimize for the numnber of decisions
Turns out that really doesn't matter.
*** revise When doing DP, since one is trying to account for all possibilities at a step, you don't have to try to do any optimizations.
Always try to come up with the simplest recurrance relation without trying to optimize too much

skip =  dp[i-1][k-1] + floor[i] == 0?  1 : 0;
cover = dp[i-1][k-1]
dp[i][j] = Math.min ( skip, cover )

1553H. Minimum Number of Days to Eat N Oranges

attempt 1:    1 +  Math.min ( minDays(n-1) ,   Math.min ( n % 3 == 0 ? minDays( n  / 3) : Integer.MAX,
                                                             n % 2  == 0 ? minDays( n /2 ) : Integer.MAX)
                             );

               This would result in too many states. Its never profitable to eat 1 apple a day for more than 2 days at a time.
               A greedy approach is needed.  We need to greedily either eat n % 2 or n % 3 apple at a time so that we can make the
               number of remaining apples divisible by 2 or 3.


attempt 2:  1 +  Math.min ( n % 3 == 0 ? minDays( n / 3) : n % 3  + minDays( n - n % 3)  ,
                                 n % 2 == 0 ? minDays( n  / 2) : n % 2  + minDays( n - n % 2) );

           same as:
           1 +  Math.min ( n % 3 == 0 ? minDays( n  / 3) : n % 3  + minDays( n/3)  ,
                                           n % 2 == 0 ? minDays( n  / 2) : n % 2  + minDays( n /2) );

           same as:
           1 +  Math.min ( n % 3  + minDays( n/3)  ,  n % 2  + minDays( n /2) )

935. Knight Dialer
Besides the obvious recursion + memoization O(n^3), there is a  DP solution.
Initially all cells have an equal score of 1. (n = 1)
Consider all the other cells you could come from, to get to a particular cell. Calculate the new score as a sum of scores from
these other cells (n = 2). Now iterate  until N.  O(n) solution.
