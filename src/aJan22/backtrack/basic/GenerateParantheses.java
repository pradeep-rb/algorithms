    22. Generate Parentheses

      This might not seem like a backtracking problem but it actually is.  The back tracking is actually quite subtle
      At every point in the decision tree, you got to decide if you need a  open ( |*OR*| close ) parentheses
      The  choice making / OR -> is where the backtracking comes in to picture.
        During the recursion, If you have  already made a choice (and ready to explore that path), you need to undo that choice
        and explore some other choices, essentially backtracking.

      So the backtracking in this problem can be done in the following way:
       String newPath = path + ("("); and pass the new path to the recursion call

       revise: note the implicit backtracking on the variable open:  open +  1 inside the backtrack method

           // String newPath = path + ("(");
            backtrack( path + "(", open + 1 , close, n );

        }
        if(close < open ) {
          //  path = path + (")");
            backtrack( path + ")", open, close + 1, n);
